        <p><strong> am dedicating this my first website to young developers like me.</strong></p>
        <p>Instead, expect to google these concepts in the future when you need to use them.<br> 
            They also have some projects at the end of this section. They’re good practice, but you can consider them optional. 
            <br>(A large part of their proposed ‘300 hours’ for completion comes from these projects 
            <br> <b>so it probably won’t take you that long if you only do the exercises).</b>
